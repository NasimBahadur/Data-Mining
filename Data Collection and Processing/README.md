In this Data Mining related work, Data is collected and processed from diferent kind of source for further data mining work. There are two types of data collection and processing (DCP) functionality append pattern and flip pattern. The running time for certain dataset for a particular threshold should be too high that may not end in years. On the other hand for threshold on a particular dataset, there may not be any patterns available. So, choosing right threshold for each dataset is a challenge. In order to save your time from waiting for outputs, you can write a batch file for windows or a shell script for linux/mac where all the runs with required parameters or switches are listed. Once you run the script or batch from a command line, you may set out for other works leaving your computer dealing with the computation by itself. Just make sure no one turns your computer off while the batch/script is running. For your reference, a sample batch/script file is shown below. Your program must include all kind of exception handling. In case of an invalid switch or invalid value for a particular switch, your program should show a helpful hint instead of treating the value in an inappropriate way or terminating abruptly.
